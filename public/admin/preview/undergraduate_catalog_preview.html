<h2><strong>MISSION AND VISION</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As a regional, state-assisted institution of higher education, the University of North Alabama pursues its <strong>Mission </strong>of engaging in teaching, research, and service in order to provide educational opportunities for students, an environment for discovery and creative accomplishment, and a variety of outreach activities meeting the professional, civic, social, cultural, and economic development needs of our region in the context of a global community.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The <strong>Vision </strong>of the University of North Alabama builds upon nearly two centuries of academic excellence. We commit ourselves to design and offer a rich undergraduate experience; to respond to the many educational and outreach needs of our region, including the provision of high quality graduate programs in selected disciplines; to provide an extracurricular environment that supports and enhances learning; to provide a global education and participate in global outreach through distance learning programs; and to foster a diverse and inclusive academic community. We promote global awareness by offering a curriculum that advances understanding of global interdependence, by encouraging international travel, and by building a multinational student population. We pledge to support and encourage intellectual growth by offering primarily small, interactive classes taught by highly educated professionals, and through mentoring, internships, and other out-of-class educational opportunities.</p>

<h2><strong>UNIVERSITY VALUES</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The members of the University of North Alabama community maintain a culture that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Values students and the student learning experience both inside and outside the classroom.</li>
	<li>Adheres to personal academic and intellectual integrity.</li>
	<li>Embraces and promotes an inclusive environment that welcomes all cultural backgrounds, personal characteristics, and life situations represented in this community.</li>
	<li>Values an environment for the free expression of ideas, opinions, thoughts, and differences in people.</li>
	<li>Respects the rights, dignity and property of all.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>UNIVERSITY GOALS</strong></h2>

<p>The University of North Alabama has identified five broad university goals that guide planning and resource allocation throughout the University. These goals are intended to be aspirations in that they are assumed to inspire, to guide, and to be on-going. Each university goal should result in a number of long-term and annual initiatives that support progress toward accomplishing the broader aspiration. The five university goals are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Build and Maintain a Student-Centered University.</li>
	<li>Build an Enriched Academic Experience.</li>
	<li>Enhance Programs that Distinguish the University.</li>
	<li>Promote an Inclusive Campus Environment.</li>
	<li>Support Regional Development and Outreach.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>HISTORY AND LOCATION</strong></h2>

<p>The University of North Alabama traces its origin to LaGrange College, which was established in 1830 at LaGrange, Alabama, by the Methodist Church, and then to its successor, Wesleyan University, established in Florence in 1855. In 1872, the school was established as a State Normal School, the first of its kind in the South. Across the years, the continued growth of the institution in size, scope, and purpose is reflected by a series of name changes: Florence State Teachers College (1929), Florence State College (1957), Florence State University (1968), and the University of North Alabama (1974).</p>

<p>The University occupies over 200 acres in Florence, Alabama, which is located just north of the Tennessee River and is the largest of four cities that make up an area referred to as the &ldquo;Shoals.&rdquo; According to the Shoals Area Chamber of Commerce website, the entire metropolitan area has a population of approximately 143,000 people.</p>

<p>The University is a state-assisted, coeducational institution offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs. It is organized into four academic colleges: arts and sciences, business, education and human sciences, nursing and a &ldquo;university college&rdquo; that oversees interdisciplinary studies.</p>

<h2><strong>LITERARY LANDMARK</strong></h2>

<p>The University was designated as a Literary Landmark by Friends of Libraries U.S.A. in 2006. UNA is the first site in the State of Alabama to receive this honor. The designation is based upon the role of the University in the life and writing of Pulitzer Prize winning author T.S. Stribling. Stribling, a 1903 graduate of the institution, was awarded the Pulitzer for Literature in 1933 for THE STORE. THE STORE was the second work in his epic trilogy portraying the lives of a fictional family in Lauderdale County, Alabama, as they dealt with the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the boom period of the 1920s. The University library houses an extensive collection of Stribling writings, research materials, and memorabilia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always;">Admission to the University</h1><h1><strong>ADMISSION TO THE UNIVERSITY</strong></h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Students who are seeking admission or readmission to the University must file appropriate documents with the Office of Admissions located in Coby Hall. Regardless of intended major, all applications, with the exception of international students, are processed in this office. High school and (if applicable) college transcripts are evaluated in this office, along with standardized test scores and other required admission-related items. In the case of transfer students, academic records are examined to determine eligibility for transfer credit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The academic programs in business, teacher education, and nursing have special admission requirements in addition to the general admission requirements. Acceptance to UNA does not necessarily constitute admission to any of these programs. Students who desire to enter teacher education or nursing should refer to the related sections in this catalog, visit the UNA website, and/or consult with the dean of the associated college for specific admission criteria.</p>

<h2><strong>POLICY OF NONDISCRIMINATION</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The University of North Alabama is an equal opportunity institution and does not discriminate in the admission policy on the basis of race, color, gender, religion, disability, age, or national origin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The University of North Alabama reserves the right to refuse admission to any applicant whose presence is deemed detrimental to the institution or its students.</p>

<h2><strong>PROCEDURES FOR ADMISSION</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each student must file a standard application for admission form accompanied by a nonrefundable $25.00 application fee to cover processing costs. Application forms are available in most guidance and counseling offices of high schools and junior or community colleges in Alabama and the surrounding region. Otherwise, they may be obtained by contacting the UNA Office of Admissions, UNA Box 5011, Florence, AL 35632-0001, online at <a href="http://www.una.edu/admissions">http://www.una.edu/admissions</a>, or by calling 256-765-4608. Outside of the local calling area, applicants may call 1-800-TALK-UNA (1-800-825-5862).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Students may seek admission to the University of North Alabama in any of the following categories:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Beginning Freshmen</strong>. Beginning freshmen are students who have never attended another college or university. Students who have attended another institution(s) during the summer immediately after high school graduation or have been dually enrolled while in high school are also considered to be beginning freshmen. To support the application process, they are to ask that ACT or SAT scores and high school transcripts be sent directly to the UNA Office of Admissions. Transcripts are typically sent by designated guidance counselors upon request by the students. If application is made while still enrolled in high school, the transcripts should show Admission to the University 21 the latest available grades at least through the junior year, and ACT or SAT scores. Subsequently, final transcripts must be sent showing confirmation of graduation and the graduation date. Having these documents sent to UNA is the applicant&rsquo;s responsibility, and it should be clearly understood that application procedures are incomplete until all items are on file. Failure to complete this process will jeopardize students&rsquo; admission to the University. Students seeking admission on the basis of General Education Development (GED) tests must have official copies of those scores sent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Transfer Students</strong>. Applicants who have attended other colleges or universities will be considered as transfer students. Transfer student applicants must have transcripts sent from all previously attended institutions regardless of whether or not credit was actually earned. The application process requires that students list all institutions attended. Failure to do so may result in denial of admission or subsequent cancellation of admission. Transfer students who have earned fewer than 24 semester hours of credit must also submit high school transcripts and ACT or SAT scores and must meet admission standards which are applied to beginning freshmen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Former Students</strong>. UNA students who wish to reenroll after an absence of one or more fall or spring semesters must apply for reactivation as former students. Summer terms have no effect on this category. Readmission forms are available in the Office of Admissions. Former students should refer to the reactivation requirements described later in this section under Former Students.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Transient Students</strong>. Students in good standing who are enrolled in a degree program at another college or university may, with the written approval of the parent institution, enroll at UNA as transient students. Such enrollment typically occurs during the summer months. Transient approval forms are available in the academic deans&rsquo; offices. This form should be filed instead of a transcript. Additional information is available in this section under Transient Student.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>UNA Early College</strong>. Academic achieving high school students may enroll in the UNA Early College program and take a limited number of college courses if they receive permission from their high schools. Early College students must receive special approval from the Vice Provost for International Affairs to take study abroad courses and must pay tuition for these courses and all costs involved. Forms are available in the UNA Office of Admissions or on the UNA website, and must be completed by the high school principal or guidance counselor. An official copy of the high school transcript should be sent by the high school directly to the UNA Office of Admissions. Early College tuition rate is $100 per course effective with the 2014 summer term. For application deadlines, please refer to <a href="http://www.una.edu/admissions">http://www.una.edu/admissions</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Special Students</strong>. Under certain circumstances, students may enroll at UNA as special students. These are not considered to be degree-seeking students. Admission as a special student requires approval by the Vice President for Enrollment Management. Additional information is available in this section under Special Students.</p>
